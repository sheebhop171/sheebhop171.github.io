Rewind back to 2009. I'm a freshman in college at Arizona State University sitting in a lecture hall among 300 other students listening to my professor introduce us to the Computer Science 101 course. He's  encouraging the women in the room to change majors before it's too late and dive into the world of technology. He knows most of us won't listen but a small few will. I am one of the women who won't listen because I'm too scared to take the leap into a field dominated by males. I'm not great at math nor science ... how could I possibly excel in this field then? So I'll continue down the path of Tourism Development and Management for the next four years. 

Fast forward to present day. I am a Senior Product Manager at a luxury fashion retailer managing a team of software engineers to build internal tooling - envious and astounded by the work my engineering colleagues do every day. Even though I have background in hospitality, I've still somehow managed to find my way into the field of technology. But there is still this incessant itch I haven't yet scratched that's been nagging at me since that very first lecture my freshman year of college. So I've decided to take the plunge, scratch the itch, or whatever other idiom you can use to describe the situation I now find myself in. It's time for me to make the decision I was too afraid to make in college.

Cheers to what I know will be a long and arduous journey ahead. I'm ready for it.
